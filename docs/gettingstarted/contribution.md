It is possible to make a pull request to the documentation, as it is 100% open source on GitHub.

## Changes to individual pages.

On each page of the documentation, there is an edit icon.

![Alt text](media/contribution-2.png)

When you click on the icon, the page opens directly in GitHub and from here you can make a pull request to the repository.

The pull request is reviewed by Innova IT and merged if it is accepted.

## Suggestions for content that does not exist

There may be suggestions for content in the documentation that does not yet exist.

In these cases, an issue is opened in the closed Azure DevOps in the same way as if you find an error in the framework.
