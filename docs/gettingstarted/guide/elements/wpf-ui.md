# User Interface

The purpose of the "User Interface" element is solely to configure and generate code for the application's user interface.

[!note] "User Interface"
    In the following example, components from Telerik are used in the application.

    Innova IT has code generation for [Telerik](https://www.telerik.com/) and [Infragistics](https://www.infragistics.com/).

Select the "Designer" tab and click on the "Add ArchitectureItem" button, choose "User Interface".

## Configuration

When the "User Interface" element is selected, the following designer is displayed:

![Alt text](media/wpf-ui-5.png)

The left side lists all the entities that are selected to generate screens for. To see all entities in the application, click on "Show All entities". Here, entities are selected by checking the box.

The right side lists the fields of the selected entity. For each entity, 5 screens are created:

- Show - screen to display the individual entity.
- List - screen with a list of entities.
- Edit - screen for editing the individual entity.
- Insert - screen to insert a new entity.
- Search - screen for searching.

By checking a box next to a field, under a "screen", it means that the field will be included in the screen.

So in the example above, the fields: CompanyName, ContactName, ContactTitle, Address, and City will be shown in the list for Suppliers.

### Controls

It is auto-configured, which controls (text field, label, dropdown menu, etc.) should be used in individual fields in display, editing, insertion, and search. This is based on rules about the data type and any relationships.

For example, for the entity "Territories"

| Data types | ![](media/ui_2021-02-08-13-16-18.png) |
| Data | ![](media/_ui2021-02-08-13-14-51.png) |

The auto-configured control for the "TerritoryDescription" field is set to "Label" on Show and Textbox as UpdateControl (insert, edit, and search). This can be seen by selecting the "TerritoryDescription" field in the designer, then the configured values are displayed in the Properties window in Visual Studio.

| ![Alt text](media/wpf-ui.png) | ![Alt text](media/wpf-ui-1.png) | ![Alt text](media/wpf-ui-2.png) |

These can be configured to other controls by changing e.g. UpdateControl "Textbox" to "BigTextBox" (a large text box with line breaks). Click on "Create Code" and run the application. Then the insert/edit screen / view will look like this:

For the field / property "RegionID" there is a relation to "Region" and the control is automatically set to Label for Show and "ComboBox - Telerik" for UpdateControl:

## UI Designer
