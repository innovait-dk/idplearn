# UserSettings

The purpose of UserSettings is to store settings in the same way as AppSettings.

However, UserSettings are user-specific. This means that you can use UserSettings to, for example, save parameters that are unique to each individual user.

The table itself looks like this:

![usersettings](media/appsettings_2021-04-06-14-20-30.png)

Otherwise, the usage and the generated code are the same as AppSettings.
