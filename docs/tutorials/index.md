# Partial Classes

The code that is generated by the designer can be customized by the developer.

All code-generated files have the extension "*.tt.cs" and should not be modified, as they will be overwritten the next time code is generated.

All code-generated classes are partial, and in this way, the code-generated class can be customized and, for example, override various methods or implement partial methods.

To assist with customizing the application, the designer has "Code Tasks", which contain the most commonly used customizations.

"Code tasks" can be accessed in two ways: Via the "Configuration" tab or via the "Customization" tab.
