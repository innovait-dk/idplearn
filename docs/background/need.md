# Development of Business Applications

Business applications are crucial to support work processes in any organization. Although each application has a unique data model and business logic that matches the specific business process, there are often a range of standardized functionalities that end users expect.

Whether it's a warehouse system or a customer and order management system, the user expects certain core functionalities.

## Core Functionalities

Most business applications are based on a data model, and it's important to give users the ability to interact with these data. General functions include:

- Creation, updating, and deletion of data.
- Data search.
- Validation rules.
- History of data changes.
- Security implementation.
- Logging requirements.
- Intuitive user interface for easy navigation.

Building such an application from scratch can require significant resources in terms of time, expertise, and the number of developers involved.

## Challenges in Development

The development and maintenance of business applications can be resource-intensive. Applications often go through several versions, and the technological landscape is constantly changing. This can lead to "technical debt", where older applications become obsolete and expensive to maintain.

## Technical Debt

*Technical debt* refers to the challenges encountered when an application is not updated in step with technological development. This can be due to:

- Absence of the original developers.
- Outdated or obsolete technological frameworks.

Large technical debt can undermine the organization's productivity and make it harder to recruit talented developers.

## Administrative Management

Effective administration of business applications can be a significant cost, especially if the applications are built on different technological platforms, which can make maintenance and support challenging.
